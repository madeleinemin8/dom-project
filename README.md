# dom-project: It's My Party

I drew some animations and made a bit of a customizable party scene, this time in HTML and CSS with some event-based fun!


Controls:

Shift + Mouse click = DISCO BALL

Click your new DISCO BALL to change its color

Key 'm' = Move the dancers, switch them around!
Key 'b' = Change the background randomly!
